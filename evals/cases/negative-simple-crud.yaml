description: Simple hello world endpoint - should NOT find many risks (tests over-triggering)

input:
  scope: "hello world endpoint"
  context: |
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/")
    def hello():
        return {"message": "Hello, World!"}

    @app.get("/health")
    def health():
        return {"status": "ok"}
  depth: quick
  threshold: 80

expected:
  # Maximum thresholds - should NOT exceed these
  max_critical: 0
  max_high: 1
  max_total: 3

  # No specific categories or keywords expected
  categories: []
  keywords: []
  domains: []

notes: |
  This is a NEGATIVE test case to prevent over-triggering.
  A simple hello world endpoint has no auth, no database, no file uploads,
  no external dependencies - there should be minimal risks flagged.

  If Gremlin finds critical/high risks here, it's crying wolf.
